The ceremony will be held at [Christ Church, Georgetown](http://www.christchurchgeorgetown.org) located at 31st and O Streets Northwest. Organized in 1817 as the fourth Episcopal congregation in the portion of the District of Columbia ceded by Maryland, the present church building dates from 1885 and is the thrid on the site. An example of the victorian gothic style, its architecture and iconography stress the catholic traditions which are part of the Anglican identity.

Unfortunately, parking can be difficult in Georgetown. We suggest you review [the map](http://wedding.dev/getting-here/) for likely parking spots around the churchâ€”there are few public parking lots in the vicinity, so coming early and finding close-by street parking may be your best bet.
