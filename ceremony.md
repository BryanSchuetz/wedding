The ceremony will be held at [Christ Church, Georgetown](http://www.christchurchgeorgetown.org) located at 31st and O Streets,  Northwest. It was organized in 1817 by a group of prominent Georgetown citizens in the portion of the District of Columbia ceded by Maryland. The present structure dates from 1885 and is the third on the site; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. An example of the Victorian Gothic style, its architecture and iconography stress the catholic traditions which are part of the Anglican identity.

Unfortunately, parking can be difficult in Georgetown. We suggest you review [the map](http://wedding.dev/getting-here/) for nearby public parking lots in the vicinity. If you plan to park on the neighborhood streets of Georgetown, it's best to arrive early and allow plenty of time to circle around (and shake your fist at the heavens).
