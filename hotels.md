<p><strong>1127 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.<br>
Washington, DC 20036</strong></p>

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places and showcasing a great location in the heart of downtown D.C. near restaurants and shopping, the [Mayflower Rennaissance Hotel](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/wassh-the-mayflower-renaissance-washington-dc-hotel/) is only a couple of blocks from the Metropolitan Club where the reception will be held. Built in 1925, the hotel has a long history Presidential patronage. Hoover ate lunch there daily for 20 years, Truman lived there for the first 3 months of his Presidency, and FDR lived in Suite 776 during his pre-inaugural period and there dictated his famous “We have nothing to fear but fear itself” speech. Now a Marriott property, if you've got points or are looking to earn more, it may be a great choice. The closest Metro station is Farragut North on the Red Line. The cut-off date for booking a room at the negotiated rate is August 4. **Reservations can be [made online](https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&eventID=13948001) or by phone at 202-247-3000.**
