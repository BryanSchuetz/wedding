As with so many things in Washington, DC, history plays an important role.
 
Our reception will be held at the historic [Metropolitan Club](https://www.metroclub.com). Founded in 1863 at the height of the Civil War by six Treasury Department officials, the club is one of the oldest private institutions in Washington.

Located at its present site for more than 100 years, the mansion is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a District of Columbia historic landmark.
 
The Metropolitan Club's proximity to the White House and other icons of the nation's capital has made it a destination for many local, national and international leaders, including nearly every U.S. President since Abraham Lincoln.
