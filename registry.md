We're registered on [Zola](https://www.zola.com/registry/georgianna-and-bryan), a super cool online aggregator for wedding registries. You can buy items directly from Zola, or from a range of other stores that make up the full registry. You can also join in on a group gift, or contribute to our honeymoon fund. Everything gets managed and tracked through Zola to avoid duplicates and make things easier.

## Brick and Mortar

We also have "brick and mortar" registries if shopping online is not your thing. You can find them at [Nordstrom](https://secure.nordstrom.com/WishListSearchResults.aspx), ask customer service about the "wish list" in storeâ€”and at [Crate & Barrel](http://www.crateandbarrel.com/gift-registry/georgianna-paul-and-bryan-schuetz/r5386513). Anything you want to bring would be amazing, but as long as you bring yourself we'll be happy. We're so excited about starting our lives together and can't wait to celebrate with you.
