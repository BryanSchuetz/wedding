title: Our Registry
---

We're registered on [Zola](https://www.zola.com/registry/georgianna-and-bryan). Our registry lets you select an individual gift, join in on a group gift, or contribute to our honeymoon fund. We're so happy about starting our lives together and can't wait to celebrate with you.

We have a brick and mortar registry too if shopping online is not your thing. You can find it at [Sur La Table](http://www.surlatable.com). Anything you want to bring would be amazing, but as long as you bring yourself we'll be happy.
