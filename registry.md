title: Our Registry
---

We're registered on [Zola](https://www.zola.com/registry/georgianna-and-bryan), a super cool online aggregator for wedding registires. You can buy items directly from Zola, or from a range of other stores that make up the full registry. You can also join in on a group gift, or contribute to our honeymoon fund.

All of it gets managed and tracked through Zola to avoid duplicates and make things easier. We also have a brick and mortar registry if shopping online is not your thing. You can find it at [Sur La Table](http://www.surlatable.com). They have [store locations](http://www.surlatable.com/browse/storeLocator/storeListAll.jsp) nationwide. Anything you want to bring would be amazing, but as long as you bring yourself we'll be happy. We're so excited about starting our lives together and can't wait to celebrate with you.
