  <h2>Thanks</h2>
  <p>Super. Now that we have your current email address, we can keep you posted when we have new information to share about our wedding plans. For now, you can explore different sections of our wedding website by using the menu button in the upper right hand corner of this (and every) page.</p>
  <p>For the planners among us, you can already take a look at <a href="/registry/">our registry</a> and see if anything there strikes your fancy. Information about the ceremony, reception, hotels, travel, and more will be published just as soon as we finalize those details.</p>
